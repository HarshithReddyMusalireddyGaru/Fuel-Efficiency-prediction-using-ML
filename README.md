# Fuel-Efficiency-prediction
Project Descryption:  Car makers are continually streamlining their cycles to increment eco-friendliness,the light of the fact that the vehicle business has been developing for more than two centuries, and fuel costs are persistently expanding. Clients are turning out to bemore specific about highlights, so car creators are continuously changing their cycles to increment eco-friendliness. Utilizing Machine Learning, we are currentlyplanning the expectation models and lessening the error values for cars that havebeen made in a couple of years. Here we will use the datasets available to machine learning practitioners to create a model to predict the fuel efficiency of various kinds of vehicles acrossvarious periods. Then, you could beat a competitor to market by both having a more desirable vehicle that is also more efficient, reduc-ing wasted costs, and gaining large chunks of the market. As part of the model, we will include descriptions of many different cars from different periods using RandomForest, Linear Regression. These descriptions will include things such as cylinders,displacement, horsepower, and weight. The ML method is appropriate for this typeof analysis since it can be applied to learn patterns in data and construct modelsfrom them. Based on the analysis, which model will produce less error with better efficiency will be seen.
Algorithms Used : Linear Regression : Linear regression is a statistical technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.It assumes that the relationship between the dependent variable and the independentvariable(s) can be described by a straight line.Random Forest : Random forest is popular machine learning algorithm used forboth classification and regression tasks. It is an ensemble learning method that com-bines multiple decision trees to improve the accuracy and robustness of the model.In a random forest model, multiple decision trees are trained on different subsets ofthe data, with a random selection of features used for each tree
Pseudo Code : Load the fuel efficiency dataset into memory Preprocess the data: a. Remove any missing values b. Convert categorical variables into numeric variables using one-hot encoding or label encoding c. Normalize the numerical variables to a common scaled. Split the data into training and testing sets Choose a machine learning algorithm,such as linear regression or random forest regression Train the model on the trainingset using the chosen algorithm Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance on the testing set using a suitable metric, such as mean squared error or R-squared If the performanceis not satisfactory, try different algorithms or hyperparameters and repeat steps 4and 5 until satisfactory performance is achieved Once the model is trained, use it topredict the fuel efficiency of new vehicles by inputting their features and obtainingthe predicted fuel efficiency value
